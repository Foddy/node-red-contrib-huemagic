## Hue Bridge
The "Hue Bridge" node is a universal node that can output all settings of the bridge and status messages from other nodes.

![Hue Bridge Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302050/148696503-428cf1d0-8376-49fe-b677-979070fc92b9.png)

### Node-RED Setup Instructions

First select the desired Hue Bridge. You can optionally deactivate all automatic status messages for this node by clicking the setting “Skip global device updates / messages on this node”. The node will then no longer issue device updates.

Alternatively, you can also choose whether the initialization messages of all nodes should not be suppressed when Node-RED is started. If you activate this setting, you will receive a status message from all resources connected to the bridge after each deployment.

### Get settings / status

Outputs the current status / settings of the bridge as soon as the following message has been sent to the node. Alternatively, you can also press the button in the Node-RED interface without having to pass a message to the node beforehand.

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| payload (boolean) | Returns the current status of the bridge |

### Trigger TouchLink scan

You can couple new or old devices to the bridge using a "TouchLink scan" (e.g. after a reset). To do this, transfer the object `msg.payload` with the following content:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| touchLink (boolean) | Couples old or new devices with the bridge |

### Get all devices and resources

With the "fetch" command you can output a list of specific devices that are currently connected to the bridge. To do this, transfer the object `msg.payload` with the following content:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| fetch (string / array [string, ...]) | Can accept `light`, `group`, `button`, `motion`, `temperature`, `light_level` or `rule` as value(s) |

### Change Hue Bridge settings

You can use the following command to change specific settings on the bridge. Please note that changing the network settings requires reconfiguring the bridge on HueMagic. Transfer the object `msg.payload.settings` with the following setting options to the node:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| name (string) | Changes the name of the bridge and must contain at least 4 to a maximum of 16 characters |
| zigbeeChannel (int) | Changes the current ZigBee channel (either `11`, `15`, `20`, `25` or `0`) |
| ipAddress (string) | Changes the IP address in the network settings |
| dhcpEnabled (boolean) | `true`, activates DHCP in the network settings, `false`, deactivates the setting |
| netmask (string) | Changes the network mask in the network settings |
| gateway (string) | Specifies the gateway in the network settings |
| proxyAddress (string) | Sets a proxy address in the network settings |
| proxyPort (string / int) | Specifies the port of the proxy in the network settings |
| timeZone (string) | Changes the currently set time zone on the bridge |

### Status messages from the node

The status reports of the "Hue Bridge" node are dynamic. Although they follow a certain pattern, their output can vary depending on what action has just been carried out on the node.

#### Status object under `msg.payload`

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| id (string) | Unique ID of the Hue Bridge |
| name (string) | Currently set name |

| model (object) | Contains the model information of the bridge under `id`, `manufacturer` and `name` |

#### Fetch results under `msg.results` (optional)

If the "fetch" command has been used on the node, the bridge outputs the corresponding results under the `msg.results` object. The object contains the queried resource groups, which in turn contain all the corresponding resources in the form of an array.

#### Global status messages under `msg.updated` (optional)

Unless deactivated, the node outputs an updated status message for each resource on the bridge. The status message under `msg.updated` follows the pattern of the respective resource and varies depending on the type of device that was last updated.

#### Last command under `msg.command` (optional)

If the status of the node has changed via a certain command, the entire command that was executed is also output. Otherwise this object will not be output by the node.

## Hue Magic
The "Hue Magic" node can apply complex and custom animations to lights and groups.

![Hue Magic Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302050/148696508-51db24ea-722e-402c-9c49-8d728e036488.png)

### Node-RED Setup Instructions

First give the node a name in order to clearly classify your animation in the Node-RED interface. You then have the choice between the options "Loop" and "Restore". Select the loop option if you want your animation to run endlessly on a light or group until you manually stop it. If you want to restore the previous state of the target resource (light / group) after the animation has ended, check the "Restore" option. Otherwise the last frame of the animation remains on the respective resource.

Below you can choose from pre-made animations from HueMagic. Click on your desired animation to set it.

### Included animations
Choose one of the included animations to apply to a Hue Light or Hue Group node.

![Some included animations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302050/71556018-30e16d00-2a33-11ea-8c03-45211767ee98.gif)

### Start / stop animation

To play or stop an animation, pass an object with the following content to the node:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| payload (boolean) | `true`, starts the animation, `false`, stops the animation |

### Custom animations

If you pass your own animation to the node, the preselected, pre-defined animation (if set) will be temporarily replaced by yours. Own HueMagic animations are a sequence of commands that have been combined in an array. Each array element forms a step - whereby a step can also consist of several frames (transition effects).

Create an `array` with the respective animation steps in the form of an object and transfer it to the HueMagic node under `msg.payload.steps`.

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| delay (int) | Number of milliseconds to wait until this step is carried out |
| animation (object) | The object contains the action(s) to be carried out in this step. Identical parameters as for the "Hue Light" & "Hue Group" nodes |

If you have created your own animation that you would like to share with others, add it at `/huemagic/animations/XXX-youranimationname.json` and create a pull request. Take a look at [this directory](https://github.com/Foddy/node-red-contrib-huemagic/tree/master/huemagic/animations) for structure help.

### Example of a custom animation

This example shows what a simple animation could look like. In the first step, the delay of 500 milliseconds is waited for. The color of the light is then slowly changed to red over a period of one second. As soon as the light has completely changed to red, the second step is carried out, which also has a delay of 500 milliseconds. Finally the color changes to blue.

If you have set the animation to loop, this process is repeated indefinitely until you manually stop the animation or redeploy the node.

Pass the following object in `msg.payload` to play the example animation.

    {
        "animate": true,
        "steps": [
            {
                "delay": 500,
                "animation": {
                    "hex": "#FF0000",
                    "transitionTime": 1
                }
            },
            {
                "delay": 500,
                "animation": {
                    "hex": "#0000FF",
                    "transitionTime": 1
                }
            }
        ]
    }

### Special commands

Sometimes it makes sense to play an animation in a disorderly manner - e.g. if fire should be imitated more realistically. To play the individual steps randomly, you can pass the following command to `msg.payload.specials`:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| randomOrder (boolean / any) | `true`, activates the random playback of the individual animation steps |

### Tips and hints

This node does not output any status messages. Please connect the output of the node with a group instead of individual lights if you want to animate several lights at the same time with the same animation. The previews of the pre-made animations are simulations and may differ slightly (timing, colors) from the actual animation on a resource.

## Hue Light
The "Hue Light" node can control lights connected to the bridge and receive their status messages.

![Hue Light Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302050/148696507-bea62f97-e9ec-496a-b7a2-8bf1942a3192.png)

### Node-RED Setup Instructions

Select the pre-configured Hue Bridge and hit the search button to find all the available lights. If you already know the ID of a light, you can also enter it here manually. You can either assign a new name for the light internally or choose the predefined name. Optionally, you can also deactivate all automatic status messages for this node by clicking the setting "Skip events from node". The node will then no longer issue device updates. Alternatively, you can also choose whether the node's initialization message should not be suppressed when Node-RED is started. If you activate this setting, you will receive a status message for the currently selected light after each deployment.

If you activate the setting "Activate color naming", the node will try to describe the currently set light color for each status message. You will then receive an additional parameter with the English description of the currently set color in the output.

If you do not select a light and use the node configuration in this way, the node works in the so-called "universal mode". In this mode, the node receives and outputs all status messages of the same type. You can also apply settings in universal mode to a specific light by transferring the corresponding light ID as a string in `msg.topic` together with your settings.

### Get status

Outputs the current status of the light as soon as a `msg.payload` object with the following content has been passed to the node. Alternatively, you can also press the button in the Node-RED interface without having to pass a message to the node beforehand.

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| status (boolean) | Returns the current status of the light |

### Turn light on / off (simple)

To quickly switch a light on or off in simple mode, pass an object with the following content to the node:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| payload (boolean) | `true` switches the light on, `false` switches it off |

### Light commands (extended)

In addition to simply switching it on and off, there are also many other options available for controlling the light. All nodes in HueMagic can be controlled with additive commands. This means that you can first pass one setting and then another setting in a later command without discarding the previous setting. Transfer the following parameters to a `msg.payload` object to make more extensive settings on the light:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| on (boolean) | `true` switches the light on, `false` switches it off |
| toggle (boolean / any) | Toggles between switching on and off, depending on the previous status of the light |

| color (string) | `random` to set a random color or an English color name (e.g. `red`) |
| hex (string) | Color value in hexadecimal in the form of a string |
| rgb (array [0,0,0]) | Color value in RGB format in the form of an array |
| xyColor (object {x [float], y [float]}) | Color value in the XY color format in the form of an object |
| gradient (object {hex […]}) | An object with a supported color object (e.g. `hex`,` rgb`, ...) and several colors to set a gradient to supported lights |
| mixColor (object) | A color to be mixed with the current light color. Can accept `color`, `hex`, `rgb` or `xyColor` objects and optionally `amount` (int) to indicate the mixing ratio in percent |
| image (string) | Path of an image (local or on the web) to set the current color of the light to the average color of the image |
| saturation (int) | Percentage of the saturation of the current color (beta) |
| colorTemp (int / string) | Value between 153 and 500 to set the color temperature of the light or the values `cold`, `normal`, `warm`, `hot` and `auto` - where `auto` is the color temperature based on the current time |
| incrementColorTemp (int / boolean) | Value by how much the color temperature should be warmer or `true` to make the color temperature warmer in steps of 50 |
| decrementColorTemp (int / boolean) | Value by how much the color temperature should be colder or `true` to make the color temperature colder in steps of 50 |
| transitionTime (float) | Transition time of the current setting in seconds. If `0` is entered, the light changes to the desired setting immediately. If `3` is entered, the light changes to the desired setting with a slight transition in the next 3 seconds |
| colorloop (float) | Plays a "colorloop" animation for the selected duration in seconds and then switches back to the original state of the light |
| alert (float) | Plays an "alert" animation for the selected duration in seconds and then switches back to the original state of the light |

### Status messages from the node

As soon as a change in the light settings has been detected (regardless of whether via Node-RED or externally), the following status message is returned by the node:

#### Status object under `msg.payload`

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| on (boolean) | State of the light, where `true` stands for on and `false` for off |
| brightness (int / boolean) | Current brightness in percent or `false`, if the light does not support a brightness setting |
| brightnessLevel (int / boolean) | Current brightness from 0-254 or `false`, if the light does not support a brightness setting |

#### Last command under `msg.command` (optional)

If the status of the node has changed via a certain command, the entire command that was executed is also output. Otherwise this object will not be output by the node.

## Hue Group
The "Hue Group" node can control several lights behind a group on the bridge at the same time.

![Hue Group Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302050/148696506-e5c52750-39e1-43bc-a749-056d7a8718fc.png)

### Node-RED Setup Instructions

Select the pre-configured Hue Bridge and hit the search button to find all available groups. If you already know the ID of a group, you can also enter it here manually. You can either assign a new name for the group internally or choose the predefined name. Optionally, you can also deactivate all automatic status messages for this node by clicking the setting "Skip events from node". The node will then no longer issue any updates. Alternatively, you can also choose whether the node's initialization message should not be suppressed when Node-RED is started. If you activate this setting, you will receive a status message for the currently selected group after each deployment.

If you do not select a group and use the node configuration in this way, the node works in the so-called "universal mode". In this mode, the node receives and outputs all status messages of the same type. You can also apply settings in universal mode to a specific group by transferring the corresponding group ID as a string in `msg.topic` together with your settings.

### Get status

Outputs the current status of the group as soon as a `msg.payload` object with the following content has been passed to the node. Alternatively, you can also press the button in the Node-RED interface without having to pass a message to the node beforehand.

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| status (boolean) | Returns the current status of the group |

### Turn on / off (simple)

To quickly turn an entire group on or off in simple mode, pass an object with the following content to the node. Please note that the command will only be executed if the current status of the group does not match your desired status. This means that all lights have to be switched off before you can switch them on with the `true` command.

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| payload (boolean) | `true` switches the whole group on, `false` switches them off |

### Group commands (extended)

In addition to simply switching it on and off, there are also many other options available for controlling the group. All nodes in HueMagic can be controlled with additive commands. This means that you can first pass one setting and then another setting in a later command without discarding the previous setting. Transfer the following parameters to an `msg.payload` object to make more extensive settings for the group:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| on (boolean) | `true` switches the entire group on, `false` switches it off (please note the note above) |
| toggle (boolean / any) | Toggles between switching on and off, depending on the previous status of the group |
| brightness (int / string) | Percentage value of the light brightness (0-100) or a string with the value `auto` to automatically set the light brightness based on the current time |
| brightnessLevel (int) | Numerical value of the light brightness (0-254) |
| color (string) | `random` to set a random color or an English color name (e.g. `red`) |
| hex (string) | Color value in hexadecimal in the form of a string |
| rgb (array [0,0,0]) | Color value in RGB format in the form of an array |
| xyColor (object {x [float], y [float]}) | Color value in the XY color format in the form of an object |
| image (string) | Path of an image (local or on the web) to set the current color of the group to the average color of the image |
| colorTemp (int / string) | Value between 153 and 500 to set the color temperature of the group or the values `cold`, `normal`, `warm`, `hot` and `auto` - where `auto` is the color temperature based on the current time |
| transitionTime (float) | Transition time of the current setting in seconds. If `0` is passed, the group changes to the desired setting immediately. If you pass it to `3`, the group changes to the desired setting with a slight transition in the next 3 seconds |
| colorloop (float) | Plays a “colorloop” animation for the selected duration in seconds and then changes back to the group's original state |
| alert (float) | Plays an "alert" animation for the selected duration in seconds and then switches back to the original status of the group |

### Status messages from the node

If a change in the group is detected, the following status message is returned from the node. Please note that the group only outputs status messages when either the last light is switched off or when the first light is switched on (if all were switched off beforehand).

In contrast to the "Hue Light" node, you have much less status information available here, as a group can contain many different device types with different values that cannot be combined.

#### Status object under `msg.payload`

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| on (boolean) | State of the group, where `true` stands for on and `false` for off |
| updated (string) | Time of the last update of the resource by HueMagic (ISO 8601) |

#### Information about the group under `msg.info`

| idV1 (string / boolean) | Indicates the old ID of the group |
| name (string) | The currently set name of the group |
| resources (object) | Contains all devices/resources behind the group
| type (string) | The type of the group (always `group`) |

#### Status changes under `msg.updated`

Lists individual parameters in the form of an object that have changed compared to the last state of the group. If no changes have been registered, this object is empty.

#### Last status of the light under `msg.lastState`

Contains the complete status object (see output values above) of the last status before the last change. If the last state of HueMagic has not yet been registered, it will output `false`.

#### Last command under `msg.command` (optional)

If the status of the node has changed via a certain command, the entire command that was executed is also output. Otherwise this object will not be output by the node.

## Hue Scene
The "Hue Scene" node can resume scenes saved in the bridge and apply them to certain groups.

![Hue Scene Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302050/148696512-c9cf3800-935f-44b3-a5e6-8c5e70a71357.png)

### Node-RED Setup Instructions

Select the pre-configured Hue Bridge and hit the search button to find all the available scenes. If you already know the ID of the scene, you can also enter it here manually. Alternatively, you can also assign an internal name for the scene or choose the predefined name of the scene.

### Activate scene

You can activate a predefined scene by transferring an object with the following content:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| payload (boolean) | Activates a preconfigured scene |

### Activate scene in universal mode

If you operate this node in the so-called "universal mode" and have not set a scene in the node configuration, you can also transfer your desired scene to the node as a command. To do this, pass a `msg.payload` object with the following content:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| scene (string) | ID of the scene to be activated on the bridge |

### Activate scene on certain groups

Connect the output of this node to one or more groups to apply a scene to specific groups. Alternatively, you have the option of doing this "dynamically" by passing an `msg.payload` object with the following content to the node:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| group (string / array [string,…]) | ID of the group or an array with the IDs of several groups in order to limit the scene to these groups |

### More information about the Node

This node does not issue any status messages. Please also note that you can only apply scenes to groups if these are already linked to the respective scene on the bridge. Otherwise nothing will be applied.

## Hue Buttons
The "Hue Buttons" node receives switching events from input devices connected to the bridge.

![Hue Buttons Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5302050/148696505-026a3eaf-b5a6-4438-ad71-57d62830799f.png)

### Node-RED Setup Instructions

Select the pre-configured Hue Bridge and hit the search button to find all the available switches/buttons. If you already know the ID of the switches/buttons, you can also enter it here manually. You can either assign a new name for the switches/buttons internally or keep the predefined name of the device. Optionally, you can also deactivate all automatic status messages for this node by clicking the setting "Skip events from node". The node will then no longer output any switching events. Alternatively, you can also choose whether the node's initialization message should not be suppressed when Node-RED is started. If you activate this setting, you will receive a status message for the currently selected switches/buttons after each deployment.

If you do not select a switch/button and use the node configuration in this way, the node works in the so-called "universal mode". In this mode, the node receives and outputs all status messages of the same type.

### Get status

Outputs the current status of the switch/button as soon as a `msg.payload` object with the following content has been passed to the node. Alternatively, you can also press the button in the Node-RED interface without having to pass a message to the node beforehand.

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
| status (boolean) | Returns the current status of the switch/button |

### v4.0.3

> **Attention!** HueMagic v4+ has been almost completely rewritten under the hood and requires at least the (square-shaped) Philips Hue Bridge firmware 1948086000+ from November 1st, 2021 ([Upgrade instructions](https://www.lighting.philips.com/content/B2C/en_US/microsites/meethue/marketing-catalog/huewireless_ca/support/security-advisory/general/where-and-how-can-i-update-my-hue-system-with-the-latest-software.html)) and Node-RED v1+ ([Upgrade instructions](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local#upgrading-node-red)). If you are upgrading from a previous HueMagic version to the v4, you will have to reconfigure (not completely rebuild) all nodes by clicking them and selecting the appropriate device from the list. This also applies to nodes / functions that are operated in universal mode, as the numeric identifiers of the latest Philips Hue API version have been replaced in UUIDs. The nodes "Hue Switch", "Hue Button" & "Hue Tap" have been replaced in v4 by the universal and uniform node "Hue Buttons", which works with all button / switch devices that are connected to the Hue Bridge (please note here also the new API in the documentation). The request and return objects of the individual nodes are largely compatible with older HueMagic versions - with the exception of the nodes "Hue Bridge", "Hue Buttons", "Hue Scene" & "Hue Group". These need to be adjusted in the v4. Make sure that you meet the minimum technical requirements and have a quiet minute for the migration before upgrading to the v4.

* HueMagic speaks now directly with the bridge without any submodules *(huejay dependency removed)*
* Migrated to the newest CLIP/v2 API version from the Philips Hue bridge
