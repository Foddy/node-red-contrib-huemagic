    The "Hue contact" node can register and report movements from a suitable sensor on the bridge.
    
    ### Setup
    
    Select the pre-configured Hue Bridge and click the search button to find all the available sensors. If you already know the ID of the sensor, you can also enter it here manually. You can either assign a new name for the sensor internally or choose the predefined name of the sensor. Optionally, you can also deactivate all automatic status messages for this node by clicking the setting "Skip events from node". The node will then no longer issue device updates. Alternatively, you can also choose whether the node's initialization message should not be suppressed when Node-RED is started. If you activate this setting, you will receive a status message for the currently selected sensor after each deployment.
    
    If you do not select a sensor and use the node configuration in this way, the node works in the so-called "universal mode". In this mode, the node receives and outputs all status messages of the same type. You can also apply settings in universal mode to a specific sensor by transferring the corresponding sensor ID as a string in `msg.topic` together with your settings.
    
    ### Get status
    
    Outputs the current status of the sensor as soon as a `msg.payload` object with the following content has been transferred to the node. Alternatively, you can also press the button in the Node-RED interface without having to pass a message to the node beforehand.
    
    : status (boolean): Returns the current status of the sensor
    
    ### Turn the sensor on / off
    
    If necessary, the sensor can be turned on and off remotely. If the sensor has been turned off, it no longer registers any movements and accordingly no longer outputs them. To do this, pass an object with the following content:
    
    : payload (boolean): `true` turns the sensor on, `false` turns it off
    
    ### Status messages from the node
    
    As soon as the sensor has registered a movement, the following status message is returned by the node:
    
    #### Status object under `msg.payload`
    
    : reachable (boolean | string): `true` if the sensor is connected to the bridge, `unknown` if the connection status deviates
    : connectionStatus (string): The current connection status with the bridge in the form of a string. Can contain `connected`, `disconnected`, `connectivity_issue` or `unidirectional_incoming` as a value
    : contact (string): Indicates whether the sensor is contacted or not
    : updated (string): Time of the last update of the resource by HueMagic (ISO 8601)
    
    #### Information about the sensor under `msg.info`
    
    : id (string): Indicates the new ID of the sensor
    : idV1 (string | boolean): Indicates the old ID of the sensor
    : uniqueId (string): The unique ID of the sensor
    : deviceId (string): The unique ID of the device
    : name (string): The currently set name of the sensor
    : type (string): The type of the sensor (always `contact`)
    : softwareVersion (string): The current firmware of the sensor
    : battery (float): The current battery level of the sensor
    : batteryState (string): The current status of the battery level. Can contain `normal`, `low` or `critical` as a value
    : model (object): Contains the model information of the sensor under `id`, `manufacturer`, `name`, `type` and `certified`
    
    #### Status changes under `msg.updated`
    
    Lists individual parameters in the form of an object that have changed compared to the last state of the sensor. If no changes have been registered, this object is empty.
    
    #### Last status of the sensor under `msg.lastState`
    
    Contains the complete status object (see output values above) of the last status before the last registered change. If the last state of HueMagic has not yet been registered, it will output `false`.
    
    #### Last command under `msg.command` (optional)
    
    If the status of the node has changed via a certain command, the entire command that was executed is also output. Otherwise this object will not be output by the node.
