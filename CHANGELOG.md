### v4.0.3

> **Attention!** HueMagic v4+ has been almost completely rewritten under the hood and requires at least the (square-shaped) Philips Hue Bridge firmware 1948086000+ from November 1st, 2021 ([Upgrade instructions](https://www.lighting.philips.com/content/B2C/en_US/microsites/meethue/marketing-catalog/huewireless_ca/support/security-advisory/general/where-and-how-can-i-update-my-hue-system-with-the-latest-software.html)) and Node-RED v1+ ([Upgrade instructions](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local#upgrading-node-red)). If you are upgrading from a previous HueMagic version to the v4, you will have to reconfigure (not completely rebuild) all nodes by clicking them and selecting the appropriate device from the list. This also applies to nodes / functions that are operated in universal mode, as the numeric identifiers of the latest Philips Hue API version have been replaced in UUIDs. The nodes "Hue Switch", "Hue Button" & "Hue Tap" have been replaced in v4 by the universal and uniform node "Hue Buttons", which works with all button / switch devices that are connected to the Hue Bridge (please note here also the new API in the documentation). The request and return objects of the individual nodes are largely compatible with older HueMagic versions - with the exception of the nodes "Hue Bridge", "Hue Buttons", "Hue Scene" & "Hue Group". These need to be adjusted in the v4. Make sure that you meet the minimum technical requirements and have a quiet minute for the migration before upgrading to the v4.
